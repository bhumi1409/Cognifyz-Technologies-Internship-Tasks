# Restaurant Data Analysis Projects

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for various tasks I completed as part of my internship at Cognifyz Technologies. The tasks are divided into three levels, each focusing on different aspects of restaurant data analysis.

## Level 1: Basic Analysis

### Task 1: Top Cuisines
- **Objective:** Determine the top three most common cuisines in the dataset and calculate the percentage of restaurants that serve each of the top cuisines.
- **Approach:** Analyzed the dataset to identify the most frequent cuisines and computed the percentage for each.

### Task 2: City Analysis
- **Objective:** Identify the city with the highest number of restaurants, calculate the average rating for restaurants in each city, and determine the city with the highest average rating.
- **Approach:** Used city-wise aggregation and rating analysis to derive insights.

### Task 3: Price Range Distribution
- **Objective:** Create visualizations to show the distribution of price ranges among the restaurants and calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price range category.
- **Approach:** Developed histograms and bar charts to represent price range distribution.

### Task 4: Online Delivery
- **Objective:** Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery and compare the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.
- **Approach:** Analyzed the dataset for online delivery options and compared the ratings.<br>

## Level 2: Intermediate Analysis

### Task 1: Restaurant Ratings
- **Objective:** Analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings and determine the most common rating range. Calculate the average number of votes received by restaurants.
- **Approach:** Conducted rating distribution analysis and vote count calculation.

### Task 2: Cuisine Combination
- **Objective:** Identify the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset and determine if certain combinations tend to have higher ratings.
- **Approach:** Explored cuisine pairings and their impact on ratings.

### Task 3: Geographic Analysis
- **Objective:** Plot restaurant locations on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates and identify any patterns or clusters of restaurants in specific areas.
- **Approach:** Utilized geographic plotting and cluster analysis.

### Task 4: Restaurant Chains
- **Objective:** Identify restaurant chains in the dataset and analyze the ratings and popularity of different chains.
- **Approach:** Investigated chain presence and performed comparative analysis on ratings.

## Level 3: Advanced Analysis

### Task 1: Restaurant Reviews
- **Objective:** Analyze text reviews to identify the most common positive and negative keywords, calculate the average length of reviews, and explore the relationship between review length and rating.
- **Approach:** Conducted text mining and sentiment analysis on reviews.

### Task 2: Votes Analysis
- **Objective:** Identify restaurants with the highest and lowest number of votes and analyze the correlation between the number of votes and restaurant ratings.
- **Approach:** Performed vote count analysis and correlation study.

### Task 3: Price Range vs. Online Delivery and Table Booking
- **Objective:** Analyze the relationship between the price range and the availability of online delivery and table booking, and determine if higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer these services.
- **Approach:** Examined the association between price range and service availability.
